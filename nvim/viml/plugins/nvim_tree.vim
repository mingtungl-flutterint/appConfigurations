    " KeyBindings

    " Default actions

    "- move around like in any vim buffer
    "- `<CR>` or `o` on `..` will cd in the above directory
    "- `<C-]>` will cd in the directory under the cursor
    "- `<BS>` will close current opened directory or parent
    "- type `a` to add a file. Adding a directory requires leaving a leading `/` at the end of the path.
    "  > you can add multiple directories by doing foo/bar/baz/f and it will add foo bar and baz directories and f as a file
    "- type `r` to rename a file
    "- type `<C-r>` to rename a file and omit the filename on input
    "- type `x` to add/remove file/directory to cut clipboard
    "- type `c` to add/remove file/directory to copy clipboard
    "- type `p` to paste from clipboard. Cut clipboard has precedence over copy (will prompt for confirmation)
    "- type `d` to delete a file (will prompt for confirmation)
    "- type `]c` to go to next git item
    "- type `[c` to go to prev git item
    "- type '-' to naviate up to the parent directory of the current file/directory
    "- if the file is a directory, `<CR>` will open the directory otherwise it will open the file in the buffer near the tree
    "- if the file is a symlink, `<CR>` will follow the symlink (if the target is a file)
    "- `<C-v>` will open the file in a vertical split
    "- `<C-x>` will open the file in a horizontal split
    "- `<C-t>` will open the file in a new tab
    "- `<Tab>` will open the file as a preview (keeps the cursor in the tree)
    "- `I` will toggle visibility of folders hidden via |g:nvim_tree_ignore|
    "- `H` will toggle visibility of dotfiles (files/folders starting with a `.`)
    "- `R` will refresh the tree
    "- Double left click acts like `<CR>`
    "- Double right click acts like `<C-]>`

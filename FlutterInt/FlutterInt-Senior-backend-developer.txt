    Proactively contribute to the improvement of development processes and standards 

    Develop and maintain scalable and maintainable backend services and APIs using Node.js 

    Design and implement RESTful APIs, and work with real-time technologies (e.g., like WebSockets where needed) 

    Collaborate with other squads, DevOps engineers, product owners, and stakeholders to deliver robust and secure backend solutions 

    Integrate with databases (SQL and NoSQL), message brokers, third-party services, and external APIs 

    Write clean, reusable, and testable code following best practices in backend development and architecture 

    Debug, troubleshoot, and optimize backend services for performance, scalability, and security 

    Contribute to documentation, including API usage, architectural decisions, and backend-specific guidelines 

    Ensure backend services are secure, efficient, and resilient 

    Participate in peer code reviews and uphold high standards for code quality and consistency across the backend team 

    Perform related duties as assigned 

What you’ll bring:   

    Working Experience: 5+ years of professional experience in mobile development, with a strong focus on building applications using Node.js 

    Proven experience in leading complex backend projects and mentoring developers 

    Strong hands-on experience with modern TypeScript Node.js development paradigms

    Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) is a plus 

    Experience with cloud platforms like AWS or other major cloud providers is a strong plus. 

Knowledge:  

    Deep expertise in Node.js ecosystem and advanced understanding of TypeScript

    Knowledge of relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and non-relational (MongoDB, Redis) databases 

    Knowledge of Nest.js would be an advantage 

    Understanding of security principles for web and API development (e.g., OWASP Top Ten) 

    Familiarity with infrastructure as code tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) is a plus
